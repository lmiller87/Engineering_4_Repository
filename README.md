### Reflection 
In this assignment I treid a slighly different code for the porject. I got it to work for about 5 minutes, however it stopped working after that and im trying to fix it. I thought I'd put my code in anyways for a grade and advice. I decided to make two variable, num1 and num2 and these depict the two different dice. Each one is rolled at the same time and each gives a number. My code is suppsoed to display them and add them together to get the sum of the two. It also asks to re roll afterwards. The main issue that I think im having/ had is the second dice rolling and them adding, the first time I did it it only printed the first number, I then messed with it for a little while and relaized I didnt have brackets and qoutations in the right places, so I got it to work from that. Im still working out the bugs and trying to get it working again.
